# ASCII Display Demo

This repository contains the design and implementation of a command line script that displays an [ASCII Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) text file in different colours. This calls back to when I used to mess around with batch files in senior high school. The only one I still have to this day is a script that displays a heart ASCII picture in different colours. As you might expect, it was very messy and bloated. I had no idea what I was doing back then.

As a quick experiment, I decided to recreate that old script using the programming techniques I know today. I also made a [flowchart](./pseudocode/readme.md) of the algorithm so that it can be implemented in other programming languages. Long story short, Windows batch scripting can be very powerful in the right hands when it comes to system administration. However, it lacks a lot of the complexities in today's programming languages that we take for granted.

## Getting Started

* To run the Windows batch script, execute `windows.bat`
* To run the Node JS script, execute `javascript.js`
